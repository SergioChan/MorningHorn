This is a warm and simple Alarm App.  

Actually, this idea and design comes from a Dribbble designer [Vicon](https://dribbble.com/Vicon) and his team [09ui](http://www.09ui.com/).  

Feeling that this idea is awesome, although there are millions of Alarm App in app store, I still want to make it into a real App.

Although this app can only play a very limited part as an Alarm, I still want it to be a warm and soft-outlooking App that can make people willing to treasure it.

Life is short for us. So is the morning light.
Think about it.
Every day, most of us get up late and miss the morning light, which is the most lively moment of a day.  We are so deeply trapped by our normal life while forgetting about the beauty of life and the world. 
That's part of the reason that I want to make it into a real App in order to awaken some part deeply buried in your heart.

'Try to follow the morning light, and let the horn sounded! Enjoy your life, mate! '
